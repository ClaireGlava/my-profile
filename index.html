						Hi there! My name is Claire Guerlava, and I'm excited to have the opportunity to introduce myself. I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia but am currently residing in Cergy. I am studying in ESSEC Business School to obtain a GBBA diploma. And I am now embarking on the next chapter of my life. In my free time, I enjoy peaceful moments, such as reading and <strong>writing and spending time with friends and family</strong>, but I also enjoy exploring new hobbies like <strong>wall-climbing, and surfing</strong>.</p>

				<h2><strong>Reading and Writing</strong></h2>
					<p>One of the recent novelists that I’ve been reading is Siri Hustvedt and Eckhart Tolle. In high school, I took a higher level of English language and literature, which deepened my interest in reading and writing. Oftentimes when I am feeling inspired, I tend to write poems, essays, or short stories. I’ve kept a private collection of my texts over the years, and I hope to continue this appreciation for the art of language.</p>

				<h2><strong>Environmentalism</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I I also have a passion for <strong>environmentalism</strong>, and have been involved in several community initiatives and youth organizations that focus on promoting sustainability and environmental conservation. I am currently seeking opportunities that will allow me to utilize these skills and continue growing as a professional. Overall, I am a driven, passionate individual who is eager to make a positive impact in the world. I look forward to getting to know others and learning more about the exciting opportunities that lie ahead.

				<h2><strong>Exploring New Hobbies</strong></h2>
					<p>Living in Jakarta, my whole life, I was starting to get bored with the repetitive lifestyle, and had to change things up every one and then to explore and find new interests. Over the last year of living in Jakarta, I pursued my interest in wall-climbing and surfing, and spent quite a bit of time exploring and learning these sports. I introduced a few of my friends to wall-climbing classes, and it became a fun hangout idea, and an interest that we pursued together. As for surfing, I dedicated a trip to Bali to learn how to surf, and although I am still at a beginner's level, I genuinely enjoyed surfing. </p>
